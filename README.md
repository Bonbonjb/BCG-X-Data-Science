PowerCo Analysis Project

Project Description

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and modeling for PowerCo, a hypothetical energy company. The primary objective is to analyze the given data, engineer relevant features, and develop predictive models to draw insights and support business decisions.

File Structure
The repository consists of three main Jupyter notebooks:

PowerCo EDA Analysis.ipynb: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis, where we investigate the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize key metrics.
PowerCo Feature Engineering.ipynb: This notebook focuses on feature engineering, where we create new features that might be useful for modeling based on the insights gained from EDA.
PowerCo Modelling.ipynb: This notebook includes the development and evaluation of various predictive models using the engineered features.
